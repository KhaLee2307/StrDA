## News üöÄüöÄüöÄ
- `2025/03/03`: üíª We have released the implementation of StrDA for TRBA and CRNN.
- `2025/02/28`: üó£Ô∏è We attended the conference, you can view the poster and slides [here](WACV2025).
- `2025/08/30`: üî• Our paper has been accepted to [WACV'25](https://wacv2025.thecvf.com/) (Algorithms Track).

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. python>=3.8.16
2. Install PyTorch-cuda>=11.3 following [official instruction](https://pytorch.org/):

        pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
        
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running (`!pip install -r requirements.txt`):

        pip install opencv-python==4.4.0.46 Pillow==7.2.0 opencv-python-headless==4.5.1.48 lmdb tqdm nltk six pyyaml

* You can also create the environment using `docker build -t StrDA .`

### Datasets
Thanks to [ku21fan/STR-Fewer-Labels](https://github.com/ku21fan/STR-Fewer-Labels/blob/main/data.md), [baudm/parseq](https://github.com/baudm/parseq/blob/main/Datasets.md), and [Mountchicken/Union14M](https://github.com/Mountchicken/Union14M) for compiling and organizing the data. Please follow their guidelines regarding the license of each dataset.

- Evaluation datasets: LMDB archives for validation and testing
- Synthetic datasets: LMDB archives for MJSynth (MJ), SynthTex (ST)
- Real-world datasets: LMDB archives for ArT, COCO-Text (COCO), LSVT, MLT19, OpenVINO, RCTW17, ReCTS, UberText (Uber), TextOCR 

## Running the code
*Please pay attention to the warnings when running the code (e.g., select_data for target domain data, checkpoint of HDGE, and trained weights of DD).*
### Training

#### Stage 1 (Domain Stratifying)

#### Stage 2 (Progressive Self-Training)

### Testing
